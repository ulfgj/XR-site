so. basically this is it:

- make sure u have `node_modules` in your `.gitignore`
- set markdown syntax to `kramdown` in your `_config.yml`
- run `npm install` to grab all dependencies from your `package.json`
- run `gulp` to open up `localhost:3000` and start editing what u need
- if all is ok, just commit to the repo and sync.
